# Domain

- Domain Layer (Business logic) is the inner-most part of the onion (without dependencies to other layers, it is totally isolated). 
- It contains Entities(Business Models), Use Cases, and Repository Interfaces. 
- This layer could be potentially reused within different projects. 
- Such separation allows for not using the host app within the test target because no dependencies (also 3rd party) are needed — this makes the Domain Use Cases tests take just a few seconds. 
- Note: Domain Layer should not include anything from other layers(e.g Presentation — UIKit or SwiftUI or Data Layer — Mapping Codable)
